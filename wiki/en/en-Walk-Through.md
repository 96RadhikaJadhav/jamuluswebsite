# Jamulus walk-through
Let's have a look what Jamulus looks like and what you should do after having installed the software.
## First start
Before each online Jam, you should close all other programs, plugin everything (LAN-cable, audio gear, etc) to minimise CPU load and to ensure that no other application wants to access your sound card. You can have a look at [Hardware Setup](Hardware-Setup) for more information how to setup your hardware. If you need help setting up ASIO4All on Windows, have a look at the [ASIO4All Setup guide on the Windows installation page](Installation-for-Windows#setting-up-asio4all).

### Jamulus main window
If you open Jamulus, you will see a window which looks like this:

![Jamulus main page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20726856/100796017-4cfa4500-3420-11eb-9d35-aa206d392a5a.png)

We will now have a look what you should do if this is the first time you open Jamulus.
### 1. Setting a profile
The first thing you should do in Jamulus is to set your profile, so that others can identify you. To do so, click on "View" at the bar on the top and on "My Profile..."
Now a window like this will open:

![Musician Profile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20726856/100796411-e590c500-3420-11eb-9b62-e50d02cb009b.png)

Fill at least "Alias/Name" and afterwards close the window to make it easier for others to identify who you are.

### 2. Connecting to a server
Now you can connect to a server. Click on "Connect" on the Jamulus main window, select your genre list (list on the top left), select a server and click on connect. Now you should be able to connect to the server. If you have problems here, they are most likely due to wrongly configured audio gear or network issues. Have a look at the [Troubleshooting page](Client-Troubleshooting).
### The first Jam
Congrats! You can now start jamming with Jamulus. The sliders you see on the right are like a mixing board: everything you change here will change your own mix. If you move something down, this user will be quieter, if you move something up, this user will be louder. It's that easy! Everything else like "PAN", "SOLO", "GRP",... are advanced options. You can of course try them!

If you don't want others to hear your audio, click on "Mute Myself" (left to the mixing board) which will stop your audio being sent to other musicians. That's sometimes a live saver (you will probably not want to disturb others with nasty phone calls).

While we're already here: "Settings" opens - of course - the settings window with all the audio settings, and "Chat" the chat window.

More information about the user interface can be found in the [Software Manual](Software-Manual).
## Advanced
Of course, you can do a lot more with Jamulus, like setting up a private server, doing online concerts,... Just click through the navigation! <!--The community publishes guides, tips, tricks on the [community site](#).  -->
