# Jamulus onboarding
Let's have a look at what Jamulus looks like and what you should do after having installed the software.
## First start
Before you start Jamulus:
1. For now, close all other applications. It's best to start from zero at first.
2. Connect everything (Ethernet cable, audio gear, etc.)

... to minimise load on your computer and to ensure that no other application tries to use your sound card.

You can have a look at [Hardware Setup](Hardware-Setup) for more information on what to do with that. If you need help setting up ASIO4All on Windows, have a look at the [ASIO4All Setup guide on the Windows installation page](Installation-for-Windows#setting-up-asio4all).

### Jamulus main window
When you open Jamulus, you will see a window which looks like this:

### 1. Setting up a profile
To let others know who you are, you should set up your profile. To do so, click on "View" (bar on the top)>"My Profile..."
Now you will see this:

Fill in at least "Alias/Name" to set your name and close the window.

### 2. Connecting to a server
Click on "Connect" in the Jamulus main window, select a genre from the list in the top left, select a server, and click on "Connect". Now you should be connected to the server. If you have problems here, they are most likely due to wrongly configured audio gear or network issues. Have a look at the [Troubleshooting page](Client-Troubleshooting).
### The first Jam
Congrats! You can now start jamming with Jamulus. The sliders you see on the right work as a mixing desk: everything you change here will change what you hear. If you move a slider down, this user will be quieter, if you move it up, this user will be louder for you. Everything else like "PAN", "SOLO", "GRP", ... are advanced options. You can try them of course!

If you don't want others to hear your audio, click on "Mute Myself" (left to the mixing board) which will stop your audio from being sent to other musicians.

While we're already here: "Settings" opens – of course – the settings window with all the audio settings, and "Chat" the chat window.

More information about using Jamulus can be found in the [Software Manual](Software-Manual).

## Advanced
Of course, you can do a lot more with Jamulus, like setting up a private server, doing online concerts, ... Have a look at the website! <!-- The community publishes guides, tips, tricks on the [community site](#).  -->
